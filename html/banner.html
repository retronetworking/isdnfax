     <h1>The banner graphics</h1>

     <p>The banner above was designed using 'gimp' on a Linux workstation.
     During the hours spent on designing the graphics, I learned a lot
     about 'gimp', which basically was my motivation for spending so much
     time designing it.  It is probably very naive, but it was fun making it.</p>

     <p>Appart from the obvious fax-page on the left, there is a 'signal-space
     diagram' that shows the complex signal-points plotted in a Re/Im coordinate
     system.  Basically, a point (marked with a cross) designates a given
     four-bit binary sequence. The distance of a point from the center indicates
     what amplitude the modulation carrier must have to transmit the given four-bit
     binary sequence, while the angle indicates how much the carrier has to be
     phase-shifted.  With 16 signal-points, there is one point for each possible
     four-bit sequence, which makes it possible to transfer 4 bits in one
     "symbol-period" or "baud".  In V.29 there are 2400 symbol periods per second,
     which gives a bit-rate of 4&nbsp;x&nbsp;2400 => 9600&nbsp;bit/s.</p>

     <p>The curve is what a given set of signal-points may translate
     into in terms of digital samples, which gradually gets smoothed as they
     turn analog somewhere along the line before they finaly reach the destination
     fax-machine.</p>

     <p>The background is basically random sequences of 0/1, but a repeating
     pattern of '01111110' can be seen, which is the "flag-sequence" used
     in the synchronous HDLC link-level protocol used among other places, in fax
     transfers.</p>
