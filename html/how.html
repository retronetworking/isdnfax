     <h1>How does it work?</h1>

     <p>Audio can be digitally sampled like on a music-CD or sound-card.
     A computer can run software algorithms on such digital samples
     that mimic the inner workings of a standard modem that may itself be designed
     purely from amplifiers, filters, signal-generators and what-not.</p>

     <p>Actually, a software algorithm can also do stuff that is
     practically impossible with standard electronic circuits, so all modern
     modems uses one or several software algorithms to perform signal analysis
     and generation. New 56k modems would be impossible where it not for
     such software algorithms. A special breed of processors called
     <i>"Digital Signal Processors"</i> (DSPs) are mostly used for this kind of
     task, as they are designed to cope with the enormous amounts of
     multiplications, additions and fast/strange indexing that are
     usually needed by the software algorithms.</p>

     <P>In modems that uses software algorithms, the circuits needed to connect
     to the phone-line resembles that of a sound-card; they can turn the
     incomming signal into digital samples, and they can convert the outgoing
     digital samples into an electrical signal suitable for the phone-line.
     Most of what happens inside a modern modem is thus the result of a
     computer program. There is basically no reason why this computer program
     can't be run on the main processor of the computer instead of inside the
     modem, except from:</p>

     <ol>

      <li>The algorithms has to be developed/known, or licensed from a company
      with experience from modem design</LI>

      <li>Running the software algorithms of a modem may be too demanding for
      the main processor of the computer.</li>

     </ol>

     <p>The second point is no longer very relevant, as computers keep
     getting faster all the time, with the occational big leap like
     the SIMD extensions of the Pentium. The first point however, is the reason
     why there is no such software for Linux.  We hope to change this.</p>

     <p>By using the (soft-) realtime scheduler in the standard Linux kernel
     and disabeling paging for the modem software, the problems with running
     a timing-critical task on a multiuser system can be solved.</p>

     <p>By using an ISDN-system, the audio-samples can be sent directly
     towards a remote fax-machine without any other equipment than the ISDN-card.
     There will probably be support for Win-modems some time in the future if
     specifications can be obtained.</p>
