G3 FAX PROTOCOL FOR DUMMIES
===========================

$Id$

The T.30 standard document being so awfully large and complicated, I have
found it of great value to assemble some of the most important protocol
information in this file, and format it according to how my brain works.
It helps me understand the protocol, and if someone else finds it
educational as well, so much the better.

Overview
--------

The two fax-machines wanting to communicate have two different roles:

   1) Called fax-machine
   2) Calling fax-machine

...which should be rather obvious, but this is imporatant:  During
the initial negotiation-phase, the roles are determined, and once
the roles are established, A calling fax-machine can only send
certain commands, and the called fax-machine can only send certain
responses.

The actual transfer of information takes place using (at least)
two modulation standards:

 1) V.21 Channel 2, 300 bit/s synchronous HDLC for signaling handshakes
 2) V.29 7200 bit/s or 9600 bit/s synchronous HDLC for payload data transfers

The first one is called "binary coded signal" in the standard... I will
call it the "low-speed" transfer; that's what it is.

The second standard is actually a two-way, 4-wire standard used only in
one direction, the direction of the transfer (which is not always from
the caller to the called).  Modern faxes can do 14400 bit/s using
V.17 instead of V.29 - they are conceptually equal with respect to
what I try to describe in this document, so I will just refer to
them both as "high-speed" transfers.

Initial negotiation
-------------------

The initial negotiation may use one of several methods to
initialize.  I will concentrate on the simple one (no V.8 support):


   Calling fax                                                     Called fax

1) ====================== Connection established ============================

2)                                        <---------- Keep quiet 0.2s or more

3) Start sending CNG (Calling tone) ------------>

4)             <---------- Start sending CED (Called terminal identification)

5)                                            <---------- Keep quiet for 75ms

6)                                              <---------- Start sending DIS

Keeping quiet is easy, so is sending CNG and CED:

CNG is used to alarm the other side that a fax-machine is calling, which
    could be done by having a nice female voice say "This is a fax-call,
    switch on your fax-machine", but no.  Instead, send a plain ugly
    sinus signal of 1100 Hz for half a second, then nothing for 3 seconds,
    and repeat to emphasize.

CED is simpler, but even uglier: Send a steady sinus of 2100 Hz for at
    least 2.6 seconds, but no more than 4.0 seconds (Ex.: 3.8 seconds).

The DIS is a low-speed transfer of identification data. The V.21
Channel 2 used for the low-speed transfers uses two frequencies of
1650 Hz and 1850 Hz to transmit zeroes and ones (very simple stuff,
standardized in 1964 or something).  The CNG, which is 1100 Hz and
transmitted in the opposite direction can still be heard by the
calling party together with the DIS, due to echos.  But since the
frequencies used by V.21 Channel 2 and 1100 Hz are so far apart,
they will not interfere with each other and all is well.

The steps above describes the T.30/4.1.1 method of an automatic
answer sequence (without sophisticated V.8 support).

Initial low-speed messages
--------------------------

The DIS is just a frame containing identification of abilities of the
called party, and is encoded just like all other commands/responses
that uses low-speed transfers.  Actually, during the initial
negotiation, the DIS may be transfered with two other optional
identification frames just ahead of it: only the DIS must be present,
and be sent last.

Some important commands:

     /------------- 0 => Originates from called fax
     !              1 => Originates from calling fax
     !
DIS, 0 000 0001, Digital Identification Signal
                 Characterizes initial capabilities of called fax.
                 "I can do this and that, if you want to send me a fax?".
                 Always sent by the Called party (as seen by the '0').

DTC, 1 000 0001, Digital Transmit Command
                 Request the called fax to transfer a page to calling fax
                 "I can do this and that, and you better send me a fax!"
                 Always sent by the Calling party (as seen by the '1').

DCS, X 100 0001, Digital Command Signal (or Data Coming Soon)
                 Indicate a high-speed transfer about to start
                 and identify which modulation it uses etc.
                 "I hear you... Fax coming up using this and that feature!"
                 Sent by either calling or called fax, and 'X' is
                 set accordingly!

Example transfers (beginning of)
--------------------------------

In a traditional fax transfer from the calling party to the called party,
we will se the following initial exchange of tones/messages (messages in
parenthesis are optional):

     Calling fax                                  Called fax

     CNG --------------------->         <--------------- CED

                                        <--- (NSF) (CSI) DIS

     (PWD) (SUB) (TSI) DCS --->

     Training, TCF ===========>

     ...

If the fax transfer is going the other way, from the called party to
the calling party (You call a fax-machine and fetches a document from
it - don't ask me how), the following happens:

     Calling fax                                  Called fax

     CNG --------------------->         <--------------- CED

                                        <--- (NSF) (CSI) DIS

     (PWD) (SEP) (CIG) DTC --->

                                        <--------- (TSI) DCS

                                        <===== Training, TCF

     CFR --------------------->

                                        <= Training, FAX-MSG

     ...

The 'Training' part is the first high-speed transfer (indicated
by a "thicker" arrow).  Training is a fixed signal sent to
measure and equalize the distortions of the phone-sytem.  The
first training-only message is used to test which speed can
be used, and the measured result is sent back with the message
CFR (Confirmation to Receive).  If things went badly, other
messages will indicate this.   Upon receiving CFR, the fax
message is transmitted (in blocks).  The TCF is a string of
zeroes, lasting 1.5 seconds (If they are received as zeroes,
all is well and CFR is sent, otherwize FTT to indicate that
the receiver failed to train.
