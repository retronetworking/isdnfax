TODO
====

This file is intended as a notepad for the developers of Fax for Linux.
The project is in the early development stage, and many loose ends
and experimental code should be expected.  [Nov 30 1998]

* The module/scrambler17.c is broken.  I have a perl-script that will
  easily generate the correct tables when this is needed. -Morten

* Decide on how to handle types correctly for the more low-level DSP
  code, so that we don't run into trouble on 64-bit systems etc., and
  modify the code accordingly.

* The module/modulator-V29.c is (hopefully) logically correct,
  but produces badly shaped signals that can't be used.
