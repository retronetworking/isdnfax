This file is intended as a notepad for the developers of Fax for Linux.
The project is in the early development stage, and many loose ends
and experimental and non-working code should be expected.

Last updated March 9, 1999

* Please use the ifax_malloc(size_t size, char *description) when
  (m)allocating memory.  It will get initialized for the benefit
  of mlock'ing later on. -Morten

* Decide on how to handle types correctly for the more low-level DSP
  code, so that we don't run into trouble on 64-bit systems etc., and
  modify the code accordingly.

  UPDATE: Use the following setup when relying on the bit-sizes
  of variables:

       #include <ifax/types.h>

       ifax_sint16             signed 16-bit integer
       ifax_uint8              unsigned 8-bit integer
       ifax_sint32             signed 32-bit integer
       etc...
