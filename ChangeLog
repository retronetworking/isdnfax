Changelog:
----------

99-06-28 [becka]:
	* modified environment.c to not abort when realtime stuff cannot be
	  initialized.
	* changed amodemd to use -D foer daemon mode as used by most other
	  daemons. -d usually means debug.
	* Changed signalgen.c to allow for direct signal setup at
	  construction time. IMHO we should split that module into a sine,
	  a noise and a silence generator.
	* Implemented syncbit.c to decouple bit extraction from the fsk-
	  demodulator stream from the bitstream decoders.
	* Changed hdlc_decoder to expect a bitstream. Both modules are 
	  untested.

98-11-29 [becka]:
	* initial release.
