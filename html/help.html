     <h1>Want to help?</h1>

     <p>The existing development team is quite busy on other projects and
     real-life tasks, so we don't think we can be of much support to
     new developers at this point.  If you do have experience in digital signal
     processing or otherwise believe that you can contribute to the project
     let us know and we will see what we can do (The current effort
     is still low-level DSP algorithms mostly).</p>

     <p>One of the problems is that the framework for how it all should
     get tied together is not fully in place yet, so we fear at this
     point in development that more programmers only will bring
     management effort up and productivity down.</p>

     <p>This is a very non-Bazar like approach to Open Source development,
     and we are not very happy about it, so we would welcome suggestions.</p>

     <p>Once the fundamental signal processing algorithms are in place,
     we expect to open up as more unrelated challenges will spring into
     existence.</p>
