Changelog:
----------
99-08-29 [morten]:
	* Changed fsk_demod to properly use its lookuptables (alaw problem)
	* Updated G3/commandframes.c to produce valid frames
	* Made incomming fax statemachine terminate for the benefit of
	  logging to file (not generate large files)
	* New configuration option 'subscriber-identification' used to
	  assign the string announced in the CSI frame (called
	  subscriber identification).
	* Minor changes to hdlc-framing.c (FCS calculation).
	* 'amodemd' now defaults to incomming fax reception simulation
	  mode with no ISDN-connection, only logging.  This is for
	  testin only, can be disabled with undef TESTING.
	* New directory 'html' created with all files from i4lfax
	  homepage.  Change the files in CVS, I'll upload them when
	  they change.
	
99-07-02 [becka]:
	* Changes to fsk_demod:
	  - First parameter at creation now gives samplerate. Allows for 
	    7200 samples/second.
	  - Changed demodulator to read signed 16 encoded data. Hope that
	    works.
	  - Heavily commented it.

99-07-01 [morten]:
	* Added new framework for State-machines, see misc/statemachines.c
	  and G3/fsm.c
	* hdlc-framing.c can now be asked if it is idle, and for how many
	  bits it has been so.  Usefull for deciding if the current frame
	  has completed so that a signal-chain reconfiguration or similar
	  can be performed.
	* The file 'G3/commandframes.c' contains a rough attempt at
	  assemblig command-frames (DIS, NSF, CSI etc.) that can be used
	  by the statemachines when various responses are needed.
	
99-06-28 [becka]:
	* modified environment.c to not abort when realtime stuff cannot be
	  initialized.
	* changed amodemd to use -D foer daemon mode as used by most other
	  daemons. -d usually means debug.
	* Changed signalgen.c to allow for direct signal setup at
	  construction time. IMHO we should split that module into a sine,
	  a noise and a silence generator.
	* Implemented syncbit.c to decouple bit extraction from the fsk-
	  demodulator stream from the bitstream decoders.
	* Changed hdlc_decoder to expect a bitstream. Both modules are 
	  untested.

98-11-29 [becka]:
	* initial release.
