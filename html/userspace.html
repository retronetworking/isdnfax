     <h1>The pros and cons of a userspace "modem"</h1>

     <p>An ongoing debate is what functionality should go into a kernel
     and which should not.  I believe a wise man said something
     similar to (this is not a correct quote, and I have no references,
     sorry):</p>

     <p><i>Improving software is best done by removing bits and pieces
     of it that is not needed, until no more can be removed.</i></p>

     <p>My personal belief is that this is a good tactic for the Linux
     kernel, as a smaller kernel is more easilly debugged and verified.
     The 'i4lfax' project is basically a userspace project. There are
     many arguments in favour of a userspace project, and a few against
     (comments welcome):</p>

     <h2>pros</h2>

     <ol>
       <li>Avoids kernel bloat, better stability of overall system
       <li>Easier development cycle (no crashes, can use debugger,
           simple to set up a dry-run and catching debugging output)
       <li>No need to sync to kernel (development/stable) or release
           the software as patches to various kernel releases
       <li>Patent problems will be localized to the userspace
           program only, and as the program can have a license
	   different from the GPL, distribution problems like the
           ones caused by the GPL can be avoided
       <li>Very easy to port to other OS
       <li>New and/or exotic IO-devices can be supported easilly, even
           if they don't exist in every kernel, or is userspace only.
     </ol>

     <p>Comments: Personally, I think (1) and (4) are the most
     fundamental and important arguments against a kernelspace
     implementation.  If (4) turns out to be a problem once inside
     the kernel, a lot of work will be needed to revert to a
     userspace solution if evicted from the kernel.</p>

     <p>Secondly (2) and (3) and (6) are very good news to the programmers,
     as it reduces development effort and helps concentrate effort where
     needed.</p>

     <p>Thirdly (5) is good news to the open source movement in general,
     and a larger user base will help improve the quality of the software.</p>

     <h2>Cons</h2>

     <ol>
       <li>Latency and regular sample delivery
       <li>Ease of use and interoperablity
     </ol>           

     <p>Comments: It seems like (1) will not be a problem, or it can
     be dealt with by improving the real-time scheduler in Linux, for
     the benefit of not only the 'i4lfax' project.</p>

     <p>The ease of use part is of unknown importance; the pty/tty
     interface can probably be made sufficiently automatic to be
     viable as a modem emulation device.</p>

     <p>The SLIP/PPP kernel-layer is also rumoured to work over ptys.  This
     is untested, but should work, and should be fixed if it doesn't.
     Some changes to the kernel may thus be needed to properly support
     a modem in a userspace process, but they should be small end
     generic.</p>
