     <h1>Motivation</h1>

     <p>The different project team members initially had somewhat different motivation,
     and probably still have. But the following points probably covers most of them:

     <ul>

      <li>Educational. There is very little DSP-software freely available for use on
      standard computers. A working fax-machine designed purly as free software could be
      a great aid to future signal processing professionals (Project team members
      included!).</li>

      <li>Practical. With ISDN installed at home, at least in Norway, you need
      to buy a separate adapter or an expensive phone with analog phone-line sockets
      in order to be able to use a standard fax-machine or fax-modem. A much simpler
      and less expensive setup would be possible if Linux could send and receive faxes
      over the ISDN-line directly.</li>

      <li>Challenge 1. Users of MS Windows can send and receive faxes using
      inexpensive ISDN-cards, and it is about time Linux catches up in this
      arena!</li>

      <li>Challenge 2. The fact that a fax-modem needs some timing-critical
      code to work is a challenge to the Linux operating-system as such.  In the
      Windows world, the fax-modems seems to be implemented as relatively low-level
      drivers with lots of backing resources. It is a challenge to implement the
      same functinality in a user-program on Linux, as the kernel is quite large
      enough already, thank you! (Except for flexible logical volume management
      and virtualized and safe graphics card drivers which I'd
      like to see in the kernel...)</li>
