Welcome to isdnfax.

1. Introduction:
----------------

Isdnfax is a project aimed at providing a fax transmission and reception 
system via the audio capabilities of ISDN4Linux or other similar systems.

Note, that this is ALPHA software, not certified by anyone, and comes
without warranty of any kind, express or implied.

CAVEAT EMPTOR. This software _should_ transmit data between ISDN4Linux
and remote modems/faxes, _but_ it might as well set them on fire, take down
the public telephone network or whatever.
The developers are in no respect reliable for any damage arising from the
use or inability to use of this software.

See the file COPYING for details on licensing and warranty.
